# dimension-based-product-quality-assurance

I have designed a dimension based product quality assurance system using arduino. 
Four IR sensor is used where first three sensors are used for length measurement with allowing some %error in length.
Last sensor is used for decision panel.
Three sonar sensors were used for  Width and Height measurement.
